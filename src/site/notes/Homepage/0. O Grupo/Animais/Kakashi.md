    desc: "`pf2:1`  The bird pecks at your foes' eyes when you create an opening. Until the start of your next turn, your Strikes that damage a creature that your bird threatens also deal 1d4 persistent bleed damage, and the target is _Dazzled_ until it removes the bleed damage. If your bird is nimble or savage, the persistent bleed damage increases to 2d4 persistent bleed.\n\n_Effect: Bird Support Benefit_"
